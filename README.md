# Schmup

This is a geometric vertical scrolling shooter in the spirit of games like Ikaruga. Itâ€™s a demonstration of different programming techniques put together to form a simple game.

# Development

Schmup requires the sound library. This can be downloaded from the Processing menu, but we have had some trouble getting this into Processing 2. We recommend that you use the available version of Processing 3, which may still be in alpha or beta.
